# YOLOv3_Object_Detection
This project implements object detection using YOLOv3 and OpenCV. It identifies 80 object categories from the COCO dataset in images, displaying bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores. The model uses pre-trained YOLOv3 weights and is fully customizable. Simply add the required files, run the script, and view the detected objects.
